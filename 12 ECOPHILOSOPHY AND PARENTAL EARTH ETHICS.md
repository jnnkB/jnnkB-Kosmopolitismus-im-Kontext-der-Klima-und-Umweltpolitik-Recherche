On the Complex Web of Being

The Judaeo-Christian view of nature which has permeated Western philosophical thought has nurtured a form of possessive individualism which is disrupting the complex web of being in which humans are a part. The Judaeo-Christian ethic has placed humans apart from nature, a factor that has contributed to global environmental degradation. There is a need for a shift towards a new epistemological outlook in which humankind is viewed as part of a complex and systematic totality of nature. This chapter argues for an ecophilosophical approach which recognizes the totality of (spatial, temporal, spiritual and other) interlinkages in nature. We illustrate the importance of taking an ecophilosophical approach with an exposition of 'parental earth ethics'.<sup>1</sup>

## Ecology and philosophy

> The Environment Crisis facing humanity is due in part to the pamosophy of possessive individualism, a philosophy which is spreading in today's World as pluralistic democracy and free market economy become the dominant political and economic norms for humanity.<sup>2</sup>

It is appropriate ot begin this chapter with this quotation from one of the distinguished scholars of philosophy in the Western world. It is now generally known that major concerns of the debate on environmental ethics in the West have been: (i) whether ethics should be restricted ot human beings or whether non-human sentient-beings should also be subjects and agents in the domain of ethics, and (il) whether any other matters in nature such as hills, rocks, rivers, also have moral value. If so, then ethics becomes eccentric rather than anthropocentric.<sup>3</sup>

> By destroying paganism, Christianity made it possible ot exploit nature in a mood of indfference to the feelings of the natural objects. It is often said that for animism the Church substituted the cult of saints. True; but the cult of saints is functionally different from animism. The saint is not *in* natural objects; he may have special shrines, but his citizenship is in heaven.... The spirits *in* natural objects, which formerly had protected nature from man, evaporated. Man's effective monopoly on spirit in this world was confirmed, and the old inhibitions on the exploitation of nature crumbled.<sup>4</sup>

Peden introduces one special view of the 19th-century American philosopher,
Francis Ellingwood, (1836-1903) who argued for a philosophical shift from
the anthropocentric conception of nature with its philosophy of possessive
individualism to universalism based on the theory of the organic constitution of
all life. A position is essentially individualistic, Peden writes, following Abbot,
if it 'seeks the ideal end of individual life' in the primary ethical welfare of the
individual. While on the other hand, a position is 'essentially universalistic' if it
identifies the ideal end with the ethical welfare of humanity, with individuals
being a part of humanity.<sup>5</sup>
Ethics traditionally (at least in the West) has concentrated on the ideal ofthe
individual while ignoring the insights provided by the biological, physical and
social sciences. We wish to consider and harmonize the views of Abbot with
the similar views of scholars who using other cultures, have contributed to the
subject of humanity and nature. And on the basis of this consideration, we shall
strive ot argue that the views of these scholars form sufficient grounds for the
assertion of the parental earth ethics. But just before we come ot that, a brief
sketch of the history or nature fo ecophilosophy, which is defined here as het
totality of the philosophy of nature, is pertinent.
Our approach differs from the traditional worldview in which nature si seen
as existing solely for satisfying the material needs of humanity. This view is
clearly articulated in the Bible which has over the centuries served as a source
of divine rules for a large section of the Western world.
In Genesis 1(: 27-28), for example, we are taught: 'So God created man in
his own image, ni the image of God he created him; male and female he
created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the
fish of the sea, and over the fowls of the air, and every living thing that moves
upon the earth".'

Western political thought has been equally influenced by the ideas of the
classical philosophers such as Aristotle who generated hierarchial justification
for the dominance of humanity over nature. nI Politics, for example, he asserts
that:
116
Plants exist [for the sake ofanimals, while] animals exists for the sake of man,the
me foruseas food, the wild, ifnot all, at least the greater part ofthem, for food
and for the provision of clothing and various instruments. Now if nature makes
nothing incomplete, and nothing in vain, the inference must be that she has made all
animals for the sake of man.
Cicero, echoing similar views in De Natura Deorum through his character,
Bulbus the Stoic reinforces this view by arguing that W]hat other use have
sheep save that their fleeces are dressed and woven into clothing for
men?. Oxen?..their necks were born for the yoke and their broad powerful
shoulders for drawing the plough.' This view was articulated ni the teachings
and Bibilical interpretations of Thomas Aquinas and acquired the status of
divine wisdom. 7
We shall depart from the anthropocentric, utilitarian and hierarchical view
of the relationship between human and nature and adopt a holistic outlook in
which everything is related to everything else. This inter-relatedness requires a
corresponding philosophical approach that looks at nature ni its totality and
derives from it ethics that reflect this outlook. We shall refer to this expositon
as ecophilosophy.
The development of ecophilosophy
The term ecology derives from the Greek word oikos which is supposed to
mean a house. The earlier precursor ot ecology was economy, which literally
means household management. But when applied to nature, economy takes the
form of the divine governance of the natural world. It is claimed that ti was Sir
Kenelm Digby who was the first ot use the term Economy (1658).8
Gilbert White: Antecedents o f ecophilosophy
The term ecology came into use in the 19th century as a better substitute for
the old expression. Worster writes that 'It]he term ecology did not appear until
1866, and ti took almost another 100 years before it entered the vernacular.'9

Ecophilosophy and Parental Earth Ethics
One of the earliest persons (in the West) to carry out the systematic study of
flora and fauna was the Englishman, Gilbert White, who ni 1789 published The
Natural History of Selborne. This was a collection of letters on wildlife,
seasons, and antiquities of White's Parish at Selborne.
According to White, '(n]ature is a great economist,' for she 'converts the
recreation of one animal ot the support of another!'10 He adds that the 'most
insignificant insects and reptiles are of much more consequence, and have
much more influence in the economy of nature, than the incurious are aware
of; Earthworms though in appearance a small and despicable link ni the chain
of nature, yet, fi lost would make alamentable chasm. 'I
The implication of White's observation is that we must be careful ni the way
wehandle nature for ti seems as fi almost everything in it has value not just for
itself but for the reality of the survival of the rest. This kind of religious-cum-
stoical attitude to nature is a contrast to the views of other Western scholars
such as Francis Bacon (1561-1626) who had earlier taught that 'the world si
made for man' and that man si not made for the world. Bacon and even no less
an institution than the Christian Church stood for exactly the opposite views to
those expressed by White. They were for what Worster refers to as 'imperial
ideology of nature - where nature is a domain in which man must rule and
exploit unchecked. 21 The position of Bacon and that of Christianity illustrate
the Western anthropocentric view of nature.

### Carl von Linné Reverential awe of nature

Despite the onslaught of the dominating Western philosophy of irreverent exploitation of nature by man, thinkers like White were not without support from some persons of genius. The Swedish pioneer-botanist, Carl von Linné (latinized as Linnaeus) lent most of his great mind ot the discovery and systematization of nature. Linnaeus wrote much, but one of his most admired essays was The OEconomy Of Nature (1749). From this we are taught that: 'we understand the all wise disposition of creator in relation to natural things, by which they are fittewd to produce general ends, and the reciprocal uses.' In this arrangement, living beings 'are so connected, so chained together that they all
aim at the same end, and to this end a vast number of intermediate ends are
subservient.'<sup>13</sup> So for Linné, al of animate nature is bound together in a common interest 'by the chains of substenance that link the living to the dead,

he predator toits prey, the beetle to the dung on which ti feeds.'14
Although Linne si known ni some versions of his work ot have postulated
that all the arrangement of nature is designed by God for the ultimate benefit
of humans, this was a mere gesture to please or reconcile his views with the
forces of the anthropocentric view of nature. Living ni the post-Baconian
scientific world and ni a dominating Christian era, Linné could not help avoid
such a 'tongue-in-cheek' compromise with his community. We can thus ignore
this aspect of his views and adopt the deeper aspect, i.e., his views about the
inter-connectedness of the ecology of nature.
Charles Darwin: A special link in ecophilosophy
We regard ecophilosophy as the totality of the philosophy of nature. In this
sense ecophilosophy is broader than such subjects as environmental studies and
environmental ethics. Environmental studies have so far, restricted themselves
ot the study of the earth and the atmosphere. Environmental ethics has not gone
much beyond the attempt ot consider the possibility of extending ethics from
numan beings to the non-human creatures on earth.
Ecophilosophy must include the totality ofboth human-made as well as non-
human-made philosophy about nature and the totality of the universe. Some of
the non-human philosophies are studied and adopted by human beings, but such
philosophies still remain non-human made. Humans have derived metaphors
from the non-human w.orld ot enrich their own understanding of the world
they

ate For xample, they have derived metaphors on
organizati
ons that ensure collective living under one sovereignty from hte ants.
They have also derived the sense of the philosophy and technology of flying
from the birds.
nI
ecop

a
significant link and affinity between the
es
of White, Linne and Darwin, the father of the theory of
evolution.
philosophi15This link can be expressed as that of the earth with al its benefits

the law of na

ture' and the

o not in any way, fi we take a deeper conception of
nature, contradict the position of White and Linné.
The practice of the survival of the fittest passes only within the level of
subservient, species-limited end, but for the ultimate end the survival of the
fittest is but a mere passing means to the ultimate arrangement or development
of nature. Thus, Linne's observations that living beings are so connected that
they all aim at the same end, link consistently with Darwin's argument that
[nJature is web of complex relations...and no individual organism or species
can live independently of that web. A parallel assumption was that even the
most insignificant creatures are important ot the welfare of their conjoining
species.'17 He acknowledged that even if they are not essential members of
society now, some time in the past they have been and are therefore part of the
historical chain of being.
Darwin's theory, like that of Line, was indeed based on ecology and not on
some form of genetics. tI is notable that Darwin's thinking was to a large
extent inspired by social theorists such as Herbert Spencer. The interplay
between soc
ial th
eo
ry
and eco
logical thoug
ht is complex and warrants a
separate assessment. 81
The White-Linne-Darwin ecological perspective contrasts sharply with the
Judaeo-Christian perspective of nature. 91 The latter we wish to refer to as the
imperial ecophilosophy as a contrast to the former which ew wish to term as
the common-earth ecophilosophy.

universalism was required as the basic principle of
ethical theory.21

is a universally self-legislating mind declaring the categorical imperative

. For Hegel, following Kant, the individual is a self-
legislating wil ni a universal perspective and there is really no ethical authority
over the subjective conscience of the individual.23
What Abbot brought to Western philosophy is the view of the organic
constitution of all life as a shift from individualistic theories. This is the notion that
every organism functions partly for the others - this means that, it is both a
means and an end to itself and to others.24 The truth of organic constitution
implies that the proper principle in human life and in nature in general is the
principle of reciprocity. Abbot writes ni his work, Scientific theism: 'Reciprocity
between hte individual and the society si wel formulated ni the old saying... "each
for al and al for each."25 Thus, Peden adds, reciprocal justice is the social ideal;
i t seeks ot cultivate ni each organism individual differences while subordinating
these differences to the universal social ideal of reciprocal justice.

Hawaiian cosmology
Gruver writes that the traditional concept of family ni the Hawaiian Islands
embraces a system of social relationships that was essentially pan-Polynesian.28 nI
Hawaii, family means ohana which comprises a matrix genealogical kinship that
extends to include al elements of creation. Both human beings and the rest of
nature occupy a position of parity that originated from environmental union of
the earth and the sky.
These two are named Papa (mother earth) and Wakea (the sky father). There
are interesting details given in this oral narration of Hawaiian cosmology on how
al the islands of Hawaii were given birth ot and how the totality of nature si
intertwined.
Dogon cosmology
Anyanwu argues that the Dogon conceptions of humans, nature, society and the
universe offer a unitary and an organic view of reality ni which humans, nature
and society are continuous with the universal creative process.29 This cosmology
emphasizes unity in diversity. It regards myths, religions, morality, politics and
economics as important forces which integrate the individual with the community.

based is thus a common good for all.
The foregoing texts lend us some solid scientific and philosophical ground
on which to postulate pan-organism as the basic truth underlying all nature.
This basic truth has two major philosophical implications. First, it means that
all aspects of nature are interconnected,
so that
the
ecological ac
tivities are a
network. So a break or imbalance in one aspect has serious consequences ni
other aspects of the domain. Secondly, ti exposes the empirical-cum-ethical plausibility of the principle of the earth sa a common good ot al mankind and
to all creatures.

This principle is seriously objected to by those who favour exclusive
individual or national survival as the fundamental truth or reality in all human
and natural relations. Let us refer to this as the principle of 'exclusive
individual or national survival. One philosophical derivative of this principle
si hte 'life boat ethics'. This is an ethics which stands ni the way of formulating
a new ethic that is built on ecophilosophy i.e. the parental earth ethics.

Parental earth ethics
Ecophilosophy can provide a practical basis upon which to formulate a new
ethics that would take into account the complexity and totality of nature. This
would be a parental earth ethics. Parental earth ethics is not simply a product
of intellectual enquiry. tI is the basis upon which different cultures around the
world base their environmental perceptions. The ethics can be presented in the
form of principles and rules. ch and

which the members have kith and kin relationship with one another. So far,
our discussion is driven towards the claim that the earth sia common wealth ot
all humanity.
We are prepared to concede that the world has no sovereign. But this does
not affect the claim that planet earth--not the world--is a common good or
heritage for all humankind. The question of the right by the first occupation or

ot overrule this truth. fI ti did, then ti would make
no sense to accept the territorial rights of the Europeans who migrated to the
Americas after Christopher Columbus 'discovered' that continent over five
hundred years ago.
The territorial rights and sovereignty in the Americas would, in that case,
rightly and legitimately belong ot the indigenous Indians. However, the reality
today is such that indigenous Indians have no more a legitimate claim to that
part of the earth than the migrants who invaded it five hundred years ago.
pr Again, fi the right of first occupation or generally the veil of fate is ot
evail over the principle of the earth as a common good for al humankind,
then all that was procured through the colonization of such places like Africa
and India should have been returned to these former colonies a long time ago.
But nowadays it seems it does not make sense to demand that such resources be
returned.
On colonialism, what we lament is the fact that those who developed
themselves by it have turned their backs on those they colonized and now claim
that they (the former subjects) have no share in or claim to any of their current
possessions. But given the organic constitution of life and the principles of
parental earth ethics, the former colonies have a legitimate claim to such
possessions.
C
onclusi
o
n
We is to con lud by attempting to answer several objections which we
forewhascomc e
see ing from
some of our readers. One such objection would be that
the earth is not a c
ain mon good in the sense of sharing whatever we have
om
ed
fro
it with everybody; the earth si a common good only in the sense
gthatti m
is an
open field f
or the survival of the fittest.
We have already cautioned against a crude interpretation of Darwin's theory
of the origin of species. A more detailed interpretation reveals that nature is a

web of complex relations and that no particular species can exist independent
of that web. 'Survival of the fittest' may sound correct when we limit ourselves
to subservient (personal, or national) ends. Such limitations have beguiled some
nations to believe that their given historical domination of others would last
forever. 31
The Third Reich of Hitler was to last 1,000 years. But ti lasted for only 12
y
ears.
The
Roman empire of course lasted a long time, but ti did not last
forever. Today the descendants of (say) the British empire would surely feel
some relief and pride ni any historical revelation of any good which the empire
did ot the colonies. For it si precisely from the goods not the evils done by
colonization that makes former subjects tolerant and at times even friendly to
the descendants of their former oppressors.
So when we take not the subservient ends of nations, but the ultimate or
organic ends of all nature, no particular species or nation could be the fittest or
weakest in accordance with the historical organic shifts of nature. Perhaps what
all nations which are rich and powerful need to do is to invest in the pool of
service to the rest of the world, so that when their historical turn or shift to
oblivion comes, others may remember them with compassion. This would be a
parental earth insurance policy.
The other objection we foresee is that parental earth ethics is a quasi-
religious exaggeration of the kinship relationships between all people of the
earth: that it is a doctrine for preachers in churches but not relevant to the real
world of the political and economic chess board.
The kinship issue is not being dragged into this matter just as a moralization
of the virtue of declaring al human beings, and all species in nature as
'brothers and sisters. tI si given here as an assertion derived from the
ecological truth about nature and the ultimate common fate of all creatures
living on planet earth. Without the element ofkinship or organic unity of
nature none of the arguments of the current environmental protectionists
wouldth m e
be valid
for al peoples and nations. But given the organic unity of

be. This is the concern hat led ot the convening of the Earth Summit
t
ni Brazil in 1992. That meeting was a symbolic family gathering.
The last objection we wish to consider is one which claims that we are
placing creatures such as even earthworms in the same moral level as human
beings. Equality of al human beings may be understandable, but how about
equality (say) between a head of state and an earthworm? The earthworm does
not demand or require equality with a head of state. But nature demands that
we do not extinguish earthworms as a species. Earthworms are a part of hte
biodiversity without which even a head of state would be non-existent.
There are basically two main
reasons ni the need for
the sustenance of
biodiversity: One is that all sentient-beings have an intrinsic value, and the
other is that human life on earth is doomed to perish if we destroy
biodiversity. Although the first reason is still too remote for most people ot
grasp, the second reason is and should be today common knowledge among
reasonable adult human beings. We propose parental earth ethics as a basic
ethics that would offer a motivation for both a global environmental concern
and a global redistribution of the wealth of nations.
